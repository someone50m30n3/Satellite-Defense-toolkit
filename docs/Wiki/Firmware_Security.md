# Firmware Integrity Monitoring

This module ensures the integrity of firmware files by detecting unauthorized modifications through cryptographic hash validation.

---

## 1. Overview

This component is designed to continuously monitor target firmware binaries or mount points and verify their integrity using secure hash algorithms. It is part of the Satellite Defense Toolkitâ€™s firmware security suite.

---

## 2. Core Features

- **Checksum Algorithms:** Supports SHA256 and MD5
- **Interval Polling:** Periodic checks configurable by the user
- **Alerting Mechanism:** Logs and notifies on detection of mismatches
- **Target Flexibility:** Monitor local firmware files or remote mounts

## 3. How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Initialization**
   - Define the path to the target firmware file.
   - Choose the hash algorithm (SHA256 preferred).

2. **Hash Calculation**
   - Compute the baseline hash at startup.
   - Optionally store this in a trusted reference file.

3. **Continuous Polling**
   - Poll the target at regular intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds).
   - Compare current hash with the reference.

4. **Detection & Response**
   - If a mismatch is found:
     - Log the incident with a timestamp.
     - Trigger an alert or dashboard update (if integrated).

## 4. Configuration Options

- `--path`: Path to firmware file
- `--interval`: Polling interval in seconds
- `--hash`: Hash algorithm to use (`sha256`, `md5`)
- `--log`: Enable local or remote logging
- `--remote`: Optional remote hash source URL

---

## 5. Roadmap / Future Enhancements

- RSA-signed firmware blob verification
- Secure remote hash pull and validation
- STIX/TAXII threat indicator export
- Full integration with dashboards and agent inventory
- Auto-pivot and remediation trigger on mismatch detection

---

## 6. Integration Points

- Compatible with dashboard for alert and status updates
- Works alongside telemetry modules for anomaly correlation
- Feeds into STIX export modules for threat intelligence sharing

# Satellite Defense Toolkit Overview

The Satellite Defense Toolkit is a modular, real-world framework designed for securing satellite-connected infrastructure. It includes tools for GNSS integrity, firmware verification, RF signal monitoring, and anomaly detection across satellite and terrestrial systems.

---

## 1. Core Capabilities

### • GNSS Spoof Detection
Detects GPS manipulation through signal analysis and model-based anomaly detection.

### • RF Jammer Localization
Locates RF interference sources using SDR-based spectrum scanning and triangulation logic.

### • Firmware Validation
Checks firmware integrity via SHA/HMAC/signature verification and scans for tampering or malware.

### • Telemetry Anomaly Detection
Monitors health metrics (voltage, temperature, etc.) using thresholds, baselines, and LSTM/ML algorithms.

### • OTA Firmware Monitoring
Extracts and analyzes firmware from OTA streams. Supports ELF/SquashFS unpacking and binary diffing.

---

## 2. Threat Intelligence & Reporting

### • YARA Threat Scanning
Performs static analysis of firmware or memory dumps using custom or standard YARA rules.

### • STIX/TAXII Reporting
Converts results to STIX 2.1 and optionally exports to a TAXII server for threat sharing or correlation.

---

## 3. Dashboard & Automation

### • Multi-Agent Dashboard
Web-based interface showing real-time telemetry, alerts, GNSS spoof attempts, and RF anomalies per agent.

### • Agent Auto-Discovery
Modules populate agent inventory dynamically, mapping IPs, tags, telemetry, and active sensors.

### • CI/CD Pipeline Support
Scripts include testable modules, alert forwarding, and GitHub Actions compatibility.

## 4. Compatibility

- Linux ground stations and simulation labs
- SDRs (RTL-SDR, HackRF, BladeRF)
- GNSS receivers and satellite-linked IoT systems
- Integrates with systemd, cron, or standalone execution

---

## 5. Intended Audience

This toolkit is built for:

- Satellite cybersecurity teams
- Aerospace SOC analysts
- National CERTs and space ISACs
- Embedded/firmware security researchers
- GNSS and telemetry system integrators

---

> All modules are designed to be operational, self-contained, and ready for red + blue team applications in real-world or emulated space environments.
